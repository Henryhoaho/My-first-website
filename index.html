    <h1 class="color">The video games I play</h1>
    <p>
      I mostly play a game called valorant and have played other shooters like
      csgo, fortnite, and many more. Sometimes I play story games such as
      Legends of zelda tears of the kingdom and marvel's spider-man, but again I
      mostly play valorant.

    <p>
      One of my favourite foods is pho, a vietnamese beef noodle dish. The other
      foods I like are pretty simple such as Japanese curry, Pizza, and
      fettuccnie alfredo.

    <h1 class="color">Anime</h1>

    <p>
      I really enjoy watching many anime from different authors and different
      genres. One of my favourite animes is one piece, I've watched over 1000
      eps on the series and enjoy the many set pieces in the series. But in the
      end my favourite anime is a movie called your name. your name is a body
      switching time travelling romance that has beatifull set pieces, with a
      beatiful sound track that all suports the story.
